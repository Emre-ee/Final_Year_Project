# Final_Year_Project
In this project, Ac current and voltage values were measured with Stm32f407 and printed on the 2x16 Lcd screen. 
Below is the voltage reading circuit I use. Microcontroller up to 250 V AC voltage is allowed to avoid voltage over 3 V. The microcontroller may be damaged if installed above. Please do not supply the microcontroller feed from the computer while this circuit is connected to the network, otherwise your computer may be damaged. Please provide the microcontroller supply voltage with a 5V adapter.
